## Floorball stats

HTML / CSS / JAVASCRIPT frontend drawing charts from data fetched from https://www.floorballbelgium.be/

Chart.js is used for the charts 

This project does not follow any good practice (no unit test, etc.) and is only a side project i started with the goal to improve my skills and knowledge in web development.
